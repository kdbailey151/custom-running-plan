# custom-running-plan
Create a customized running plan based on inputs for starting mileage, distance, goal pace and day of long-run preference.

This is a project created to help learn programming in general, and python in particular.  Eventually I would like to learn enough HTML/CSS and Javascript as well to put this on a website for fun.
